The following raw CSV files were loaded into the bronze schema using SQL Server Management Studio's Import Wizard.
Each file was mapped to its corresponding table with matching column structure and data types. Data was validated for structure and encoding prior to import.
Duplicate and type-related issues were handled either by modifying schema constraints (e.g., dropping primary keys) or adjusting data types (e.g., replacing SMALLINT with INT for zip codes).
